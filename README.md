# \#fsociety Chrome Exension

## About
\#fsociety Chrome Extension is an effort to unify the \#fsociety IRC experience of community, 
IronY's efforts with MrNodeBot, and the web.  The extension will eventually be made public 
for all our users on the Chrome Web Store.  Temporary installation instructions can be 
found below.

## Installation

1. Enable Chrome's Developer mode:
    * Go to chrome://extensions/ and check the "Developer mode" checkbox at the top.
2. Clone this git repository.  
3. Click the "Load unpacked extension..." button on chrome://extensions/.
4. Point it to the location you stored the /source directory on your harddirve.

That's it!

## Todo
* Authorize the user token on save and once every 50 api calls.
* Delay API calls if too quickly.
* Connect with Pusher API to receive data via websocket.
* Context menu "Share to IRC"
* Notifications & Nick Highlights
